        <h3 id="h3">Eminem (AKA Marshall Mathers) is a popular rapper and song-writer. He was born October 17, 1972 in St. Joseph, Missouri. His parents were Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Debbie Nelson, but his father left him and his mother when Eminem was a child. <br> As a kid, Marshall was beat up a lot. But, his love for music was first discovered when he received a soundtrack from his uncle Ronnie. Music became his escape and since he was good at it he rose to the top. <br> Marshall has gone through many hard times in his life with the two major struggles being that he had to go through a turbulent relationship with his now ex-wife Kim Scott Mathers and that he had to raise his daughter, Hailie Mathers, all by himself.
